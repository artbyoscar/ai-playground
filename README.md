## 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**

In 2025, the AI landscape is dominated by cloud giants:
- **ChatGPT Agent** costs $20-200/month and requires sending your data to OpenAI
- **Claude** limits you to 45 messages/5 hours and keeps your data
- **Perplexity** charges for deep research and doesn't work offline
- **All major platforms** lock you into their ecosystem with no exit strategy

**We're building the alternative: A fully-featured AI platform that runs on YOUR hardware, respects YOUR privacy, and gives YOU complete control.**
